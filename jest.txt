Since you're preparing for frontend/React interviews (2+ years level), I’ll give you **technical interview–oriented Jest practice questions** — not basic definitions, but scenario-based ones that are commonly asked in real interviews.

---

# 🔹 Level 1 – Core Jest Fundamentals

### 1️⃣ Mock Functions

1. What is `jest.fn()` and how does it differ from a normal function?
2. Write a test to verify a function was called exactly 3 times.
3. How do you check what arguments a mocked function received?
4. How do you mock a callback function?
5. Difference between:

   * `toHaveBeenCalled()`
   * `toHaveBeenCalledTimes()`
   * `toHaveBeenCalledWith()`

---

### 2️⃣ Mocking Modules

6. How do you mock an entire module using `jest.mock()`?
7. How do you partially mock a module?
8. How do you mock a default export?
9. How do you mock named exports?
10. What is `jest.requireActual()` used for?

---

### 3️⃣ Async Testing

11. How do you test a function that returns a Promise?
12. Difference between:

* `async/await`
* `return promise`
* `done()` callback

13. How do you test a rejected Promise?
14. What happens if you forget `await` in an async test?

---

### 4️⃣ Timers

15. How do you test `setTimeout`?
16. Difference between:

* `jest.useFakeTimers()`
* `jest.useRealTimers()`

17. How do you advance timers manually?
18. What is `jest.runAllTimers()` vs `jest.advanceTimersByTime()`?

---

# 🔹 Level 2 – React + Jest (Most Important for You)

Since you're preparing for React interviews:

---

### 5️⃣ Component Rendering

19. How do you test if a component renders correctly?
20. How do you test conditional rendering?
21. How do you test if a button click updates state?
22. How do you test form submission?
23. How do you test input change events?

---

### 6️⃣ API Testing with Mocking

24. How do you mock `fetch`?
25. How do you mock `axios`?
26. How do you test loading state?
27. How do you test error state?
28. How do you test success state?

Example scenario:

> Test a component that fetches data from JSONPlaceholder and displays a list.

---

### 7️⃣ Custom Hooks

29. How do you test a custom hook?
30. How do you mock dependencies inside a hook?
31. How do you test a hook with async logic?

---

### 8️⃣ Testing Context

32. How do you test a component that uses React Context?
33. How do you wrap a component with a provider in tests?

---

# 🔹 Level 3 – Advanced Interview Questions (High Probability)

### 9️⃣ Snapshot Testing

34. What is snapshot testing?
35. When should you avoid snapshot testing?
36. Why do snapshots sometimes create bad tests?

---

### 🔟 Mock Resetting

37. Difference between:

* `clearAllMocks`
* `resetAllMocks`
* `restoreAllMocks`

38. When would you use `beforeEach`?

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Testing Side Effects

39. How do you test `useEffect`?
40. How do you test cleanup functions?
41. How do you test event listeners?

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Edge Case Questions (Interview Trap)

42. Why is `act()` required?
43. What causes:

```
Warning: An update to Component inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)
```

44. Why might a test pass locally but fail in CI?
45. How do you debug flaky tests?

---

# 🔹 Real Coding Round Style Questions

These are the type you might get in a live round:

---

### 💻 Q1: Write tests for this function:

```js
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

---

### 💻 Q2: Test this async function:

```js
export const fetchUser = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/user');
  return res.json();
};
```

---

### 💻 Q3: Test this React component:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

### 💻 Q4: Test loading + success + error states.

# 🔥 High-Level Interview Discussion Questions

You may be asked:

* Why is testing important?
* What is the difference between unit test and integration test?
* What is code coverage?
* Should we test implementation details?
* What is TDD?
* How do you test Redux?
* How do you test React Query?
* What should NOT be tested?

---

# 🎯 Since You’re Targeting 2+ Years Experience

For your level, you MUST be comfortable with:

✔ Mocking APIs

✔ React Testing Library
✔ act()
✔ Timers
✔ Custom hooks testing
✔ Module mocking
